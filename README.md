Lib20070319 is a library to read and write _Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio_'s proprietary **20070319** file format.

<br/>

## What is 20070319?

It is a file format used in the **Yakuza** / **龍が如く** games, ranging from *Kenzan!* to *Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise*.

It is commonly used to store information in a similar way to a database table.

In the absence of an official name for this format, the modding community has chosen to adopt its header magic (`0x20070319`) as the name.
